// The frame-generation synthesizer (fix.frame_generation_shadow = on, TEMPORARY, hidden, VR only; docs/design-frame-generation-2026-10-26.md, Phase 2.1, "The synthesis pass").
// Per eye and real frame B it builds S, the frame one display period later, at output size, from B's upscaled output, depth and DLSS vectors and the head's own step; nothing
// is shown in the headset and the frame loop does not change. It runs under the shadow scorer's key (no key of its own) and is called beside it. The pure halves are
// src\common\framegen_synth_math.h (the geometry and the constant block) and framegen_synth_report.h (the statistics and the lines); the shaders are framegen_synth_shader.h.
//
// Every other real frame of an eye builds the f = 0.5 S (a later phase shows it: Elite's step is two display periods); the frames between build the f = 1 S, which lands on the
// next real frame C's time. That one is reduced to the scorer's quarter-grid luma, kept with B's luma and class, and scored against C on C's frame: the error per class of B, with
// the no-warp comparison (B against C), read back without waiting. Key off: nothing is created and nothing is dispatched.
// frameGenSynthFrameBoundary (once a frame, from temporalPassFrameBoundary) prints the one-second report.
